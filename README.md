## :clock3: Cuide-se Project :muscle:
Cuide-se (in English "take care yourself") is an application that combines the Pomodoro technique and performing exercises during the break.

The Pomodoro Technique was created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. â€“ [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 

For each interval, the user is challenged. These challenges are exercises that involve the body and the eyes, which are often attacked over time by people who work and study in front of the computer for a long time a day.
